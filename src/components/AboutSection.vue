    <p>
      Hello, I'm Karl Winkler, a software engineer and full stack web developer working on a

      I have been able to lead important projects developing end to end features in Django/React and
      Ruby on Rails, and Iâ€™m always eager to explore new technologies, having built applications in
      Go, Java Spring, and more.
